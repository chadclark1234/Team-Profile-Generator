## Description

The goal of this project was to be able to enter the information from a team and generate a professional looking web page with each member of the team displayed on a card. Each team has one manager and any number of engineers and interns.

## Challenges

This project required the use of NodeJS, Inquirer, File-System and Jest testing. The biggest challenge for me on this project was to be able to ask the questions based on the user input for which type and how many members would be on the team.
